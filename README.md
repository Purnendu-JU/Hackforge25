Health is a top priority, yet many people lack access to personalized and affordable healthcare solutions. The challenge is to develop a tool that helps users monitor their well-being, stay fit, and receive early health warnings. The solution should make healthcare more proactive, accessible, and user-friendly.
So We decided to Put health in everyone's hands. We designed an app that keeps you fit, reminds you to take meds, and spots health issues early.
This repo contains this app only!!!
